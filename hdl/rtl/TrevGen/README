==================================================
The modules in this folder has been developped in the framework of the SPS RF distribution over 
white Rabbit using DDS techniques.

	    |->  TrevGen_Module.vhd :       This is the top module used to generate revolution ticks
        |                               derived from the Bunch ticks.
        |
        |->  TrevGen_wb_slave.vhd :     Wishbone slave ".vhd" file automatically generated by WBGen2.
        |
        |->  TrevGen_wb_slave_pkg.vhd : File also generated automatically by WBGen2 that 
        |                               contains the wishbone register records definitions and
        |                               several functions.
