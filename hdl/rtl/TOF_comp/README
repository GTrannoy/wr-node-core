Trev Generator core for Spartan-6 FPGAs
==================================================
The modules in this folder has been developped in the framework of the SPS RF distribution over 
white Rabbit using DDS techniques.

   README          This file

   Manifest.py     Python file used by hdl-make to automatically sinthesize/elaborate/map/route/simulate/etc.
                   It points to the core folder.

   core/     VHDL sources of the TOF core.

	|->  TrevGen_Module.vhd :       This is the top module used to generate revolution ticks
        |                               derived from the Bunch ticks.
        |
        |->  TrevGen_wb_slave.vhd :     Wishbone slave ".vhd" file automatically generated by WBGen2.
        |
        |->  TrevGen_wb_slave_pkg.vhd : File also generated automatically by WBGen2 that 
        |                               contains the wishbone register records definitions and
        |                               several functions.
        |
        |->  TrevGen.vhd :              This file contains the logic for enabling one of the bunch clocks
        |                               ticsk as Trev tick. In order to do that tryes to calculate
        |                               when the Trev should approximately happen from the minimum
        |                               and maximum values of Trev setup in the wishbone registers and
        |                               the WR link.
        |
        |-> Manifest.py :               Python file used by hdl-make with the list of the previous
                                        listed ".vhdl" files.
                                         
   doc/      Wishbone slave interface documentation.
        |
        |->  TrevGen_wb_slave.html:     HTML file with the mapping of the wishbone registers and 
                                        their meaning.

   wb/       Wishbone slave descriptor for WBGen2 + .sh file with wbgen2 command
        |
        |->  build_wb.sh :              Shell script with the command that will generate the
        |                               wishbone slave interface, its documentation, VHDL packages,
        |                               verilog simulation files and C header files
.       |
        |->  TrevGen_wb_slave.wb :      Wishbone descriptor file
        |
        |-> It could eventually contain also some of the files generated by WBGen2 like verilog 
            simulation files and C header files.
