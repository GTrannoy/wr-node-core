Time to Digital Converter core for Spartan-6 FPGAs
==================================================
The modules in this folder has been developped in the framework of the SPS RF distribution over 
white Rabbit using DDS techniques. 
They contain the logic to time stamp an input pulse. This information is provided as the WR_cycle
at which the pulse edge was detected + the an offset (expressed in ns) from the WR_cycle start.
Detection of edges can be configured in order to detect only rising edges, falling or both.

        |->  stdc_hostif.vhd :      Top level module. Instantiates the components stdc, stdc_fifo 
        |                           and stdc_wb_slave.
        |
        |->  stdc.vhd :             It contains the instantiation of 2 Xilinx ISERDES2 components 
        |                           (master and slave) and some simple logic. It required a 
        |                           1000 MHz clock (wr_clk x8) and a serdes_clk signal (1000 MHz/8) 
        |                           synchronous to the wr_clk. 
        |
        |->  stdc_fifo.vhd   :      Time stamp of detected pulses are stored in a fifo. 2 generics  
        |                           define the length of the words and depth of the fifo.
        |
        |->  stdc_wb_slave.vhd :    Wishbone slave ".vhd" file automatically generated by WBGen2.
        |
        |->  stdc_wbgen2_pkg.vhd:   File also generated automatically by WBGen2 that 
        |                           contains the wishbone register records definitions and
        |                           several functions.
        |
        |-> Manifest.py :           Python file used by hdl-make with the list of the previous
                                    listed ".vhdl" files.
                

   doc/      Wishbone slave interface documentation.
        |
        |->  stdc_wb_slave.html:    HTML file with the mapping of the wishbone registers and 
                                    their meaning.

   wb/       Wishbone slave descriptor for WBGen2 + .sh file with wbgen2 command
        |     
        |->  build_wb.sh :           Shell script with the command that will generate the
        |                            wishbone slave interface, its documentation, VHDL packages,
        |                            verilog simulation files and C header files
.       |
        |->  stdc_wb_slave.wb :      Wishbone descriptor file
